# tree-brushup

python + refreshing myself on trees etc, learning B trees for the first time

## Setup

Requires python3.10 to be installed

clone, run `bin/setup`

## goals

- start off with a few trees I remember from school
- implement a B tree
- pull out commonalities into some sort of shared "tree engine" that can handle an abstract tree class concept
  - implement print
    - would be cool if this was interactive somehow?
  - implement balance (may just be part of insert/delete)
  - implement search
